                    In the fall of 1997, Art issues press released Air Guitar: Essays on Art and Democracy, by the essayist Dave Hickey. It was the culmination and distillation of almost a decade of writing that Hickey had done for Art issues magazine, mostly through his regular column, “Simple Hearts.” The book included essays on, among other topics, Liberace, Gustave Flaubert, Dr. J, Norman Rockwell, <span class="mouseOn photo-hov" data-img="hickey-childhood.jpg">Hickey’s childhood</span>, the often-fruitful relationship between art and commerce, and the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

                <p>
                    Hickey and his editor, Art issues founder Gary Kornblau, had reason to believe the book would do well. Their 1993 effort, The Invisible Dragon: Four Essays on Beauty, had been a cult phenomenon in the art world, and Hickey’s status had only ascended since then. The new book outperformed even their high expectations, selling more than 20,000 copies over the next few years—a number that was modest by popular fiction standards but gargantuan by art criticism standards. The success made Hickey something of a rock star in the art world.

                <p>
                    After its release, he kept going with his regular column for Art issues. The plan, though Hickey and Kornblau didn’t speak about it openly, was for him to keep writing until he had 15 or 20 really good essays, enough for another collection. This stealth process, designed to pre-empt Hickey’s book-writing anxieties, had worked well for Air Guitar.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In choosing his new subjects Hickey wrote about whatever provoked him or triggered a resonant memory, addressing “unfashionable enthusiasms, unlikely objects of desire, and other phenomena held in mysterious esteem by the author and citizens of his acquaintance.” Driving down Las Vegas Boulevard one morning, he heard the Carpenters’ 1972 ballad “Goodbye to Love” on the radio. It reminded him of when he’d first heard the song decades before, not long after he and his first wife moved to New York City, and from that connection he spun out an essay about the song, the early 1970s, the mechanics of crafting pop music, the relationship between art and information theory, and the difference between what we want and what we desire.

                <p>
                    After the actor Robert Mitchum died, in the summer of 1997, Hickey wrote about what Mitchum had meant to him in the 1940s and ‘50s, when in “the bland, herbivorous pasture of popular entertainment, [Mitchum] was the single, successful, visible icon of America’s dark inheritance.” In other essays he wrote about the rock-n-roll spirit of Josep Van Lieshout’s architecture, the difference between writing and talking about art, and two PBS art history documentaries, one narrated by the critic Robert Hughes and the other by the English nun Sister Wendy.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And what did I learn?” he wrote. “Well, I learned that an English nun, who lives a fully contemplative existence under protection of a Carmelite monastery, is a more beguiling and reliable guide to the worldly practice of Western art than the dean of American art critics, simply because this cloistered sister accepts the fact that works of art are always compensatory objects made by fallible human beings for dubious reasons in an inadequate world.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reading in the news that Richard Pryor’s multiple sclerosis had advanced to the point where the legendary comic wouldn’t be able to work anymore, Hickey meditated on his own personal debt to Pryor as well as on the nature of Pryor’s art, which was “part Mark Twain and part Rudyard Kipling, part Lenny Bruce and part Uncle Remus, with a little Magic Realism thrown in.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “His primary gift to me,” Hickey wrote, “…was his ability to portray everything from the inside—the scariness of it. To this day, I am shocked and amazed at the very idea that a human being would have the courage to walk out there on stage, to stand alone in the light with a sensibility that delicate and protean, with a sense of self so fragile and fluid that it can’t help but evanesce into the world around it and animate that world from within. That’s courage, my friend. And that is what I miss the most: the rich, effortless paganism Pryor evokes, the living world of living bodies he totally inhabits. Because Pryor not only chats with monkeys and German Shepherds, he converses with God, with his dick, his heart, and his liver, with Malamutes, horses, deer, junkies, cops, lions, aunties, white ladies, evangelists, snot bubbles, and the wind off the lake in Chicago—and he chats with them about everything.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hickey’s writing in those years was continuous with what had been collected in Air Guitar but rarely redundant. He found new and fascinating things to say about the complex relationship between art, democracy and commerce; about the art world and its misconstruals of the nature of art and beauty; about the “re-farmerization” of America and the ways in which art sublimates and civilizes violence. He gave the kind of sustained critical attention to popular artists like Pryor and Mitchum that he’d given in the past to figures like Rockwell and Hank Williams.

                    In general, based just on the text, the future seemed both clear and bright. He would keep writing these essays, and when enough of them had accumulated he and Kornblau would pull them together into a draft of a collection. Then he would go back and put more pressure on the essays, revising each in order to make it more euphonious and more connected to its siblings. Then the two men would settle on an evocative, enigmatic title, and they’d work with one of their designer friends to make the book look cool. This next book might not blow up in the way that the previous two books had; you couldn’t count on that. But it would be excellent, and it would extend and enrich Hickey’s body of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “By 1999 or 2000, we had the core of it,” said Kornblau. “It was as good as Air Guitar, or better. I had it in my mind that it was going to be published in 2001.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was trouble in paradise, though. After the extraordinary success of Air Guitar, more people wanted what Hickey had. He was sought after for lectures, catalog essays, and teaching gigs. He began to travel more frequently, and to take on writing assignments that didn’t align as well with his talents and temperament. This was particularly evident in the catalog essays he wrote during this period, which were both better, by and large, than what the museums or galleries would have gotten from most other writers in the pool, and baggier and less interesting than what Hickey had been writing for Art issues. Forced to tether himself to a specific artist, severed from politics and the larger culture, Hickey was smart and eloquent but rarely essential. It wasn’t even clear, in some cases, whether he admired the artists he was writing about. But he was such a good writer of paragraphs that no one seemed to care.

                    In 2001, Kornblau got a letter from the MacArthur Foundation. They were considering whether to award one of their “genius” fellowships to Hickey, and they were hoping Kornblau would write a letter of recommendation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “They asked me what use giving Dave a MacArthur would do,” says Kornblau. “How would it help him?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kornblau and another colleague, who’d also been solicited for a letter, strategized. The other guy would praise Hickey’s accomplishments and influence. Kornblau would play it cool. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I wrote two sentences,” he remembers. “I said they shouldn’t be asking what the award will do for the Dave. They should be asking what giving the fellowship to Dave will do for the MacArthur Foundation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later that year Hickey was awarded the $500,000 fellowship. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That is where everything really fell apart,” says Kornblau. Hickey stopped writing for Art issues, and Kornblau soon shuttered the magazine. Hickey signed a contract to write a different book—not the collection of essays from Art issues—and then struggled with the book from the outset. He gambled away a lot of the money from the MacArthur, spending long afternoons and evenings playing video poker and Texas Hold ‘Em. He began encountering public criticism that seemed more focused on him, as an embodiment of reactionary politics, than on his writing, and his occasional reactive outbursts made things worse. Particularly painful, for Hickey, were the troubles he began to have at The University of Nevada Las Vegas, where he was a professor of art history and theory. He had never been very good at playing the kind of departmental politics that help contain rivalry and jealousy, but for most of his tenure at UNLV it hadn’t mattered that much. He’d taught his classes, and his fellow faculty had left him alone. After the success of Air Guitar, and in particular after the MacArthur fellowship, he was too prominent to avoid being targeted. There were public and private conflicts with other faculty and administrators, and subtle and flagrant attacks on him and on his wife, Libby Lumpkin, who was an untenured member of the faculty.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Everything that could go wrong did,” remembers Hickey. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fallout was diffusion, anxiety, and a gradual deterioration of the delicate constellation of forces that for more than a decade had enabled Hickey to write his best. He continued to write essays that were as good as anything he’d done before, but not as many of them and not as often. He’d never again publish a book as good as Air Guitar. In fact, he wouldn’t even publish another book for 15 years, and his best work of the late 1990s and early 2000s would remain buried in the archives or would be parceled out, to diminished effect, in lesser books.
